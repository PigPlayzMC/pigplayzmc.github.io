## Reporting a Vulnerability

Email website@westcountryrepairs.co.uk to report vunerabilities. Do not open an issue for security concerns.
 You will receive email confirmation and possible followups as the issue is resolved. Please note that improper
 or timewasting reports will result in blacklisting and an inability to report security vunerabilities in the future. Thank you for your cooperation.
