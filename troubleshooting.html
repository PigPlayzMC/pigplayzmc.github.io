        <p>Welcome to the troubleshooting page. If you have a

            these instructions, you have the best chance of 
            sorting the problem by yourself.<br><br>

                This might seem obvious but if you're having an problem 
                with your computer, phone, or other device, this is a 
                great first step. Powering off then powering back on 
                can fix a lot of common problems and is a great way 
                to get your tech back up and running without any 
                cost. For instructions on rebooting your specific device, 
                keep reading.<br><br>

                <h2>Linux: </h2>
                To reboot on a Linux machine, you can open a terminal window 
                and type the command; "reboot". If you can't open a 
                terminal window, there should be a physical power key on your 
                device which you can press and hold until the device powers off.
                For help finding yours, search "<i>your-device</i> power button". If 
                you use your physical button, remember to turn the device back on!<br><br>

                <h2>Windows: </h2>
                To reboot a device running Windows, move your mouse to the bottom 
                left of the screen and click the Windows logo, or press the Windows 
                key on your keyboard. This should open a window with a power button 
                at the bottom right corner. Clicking this will provide several options. 
                Click the "Restart" button and wait. Alternatively, if this doesn't work, 
                your device should have a physical power button which you can press and hold 
                until your device shuts off. For help finding yours, search 
                "<i>your-device</i> power button". Then just power your device back on!<br><br>

                <h2>MacOS: </h2>
                Your Mac device can be rebooted by holding the power button on your 
                keyboard, pressing "fn" and "f12" then selecting "Shutdown", or clicking 
                the Apple logo in the top left corner of your screen and select the 
                "Shut Down..." button. Then turn the device back on with the power button!<br><br>

                <h2>iPhone: </h2>
                Restarting your iPhone is as simple as pressing and holding the power 
                button. This should bring a slider up on the top of the screen. Drag 
                the slider towards the right edge and the phone should power off. Then 
                hold the power button until the white Apple logo appears. Your phone 
                should then be powered on!<br><br>

                <h2>iPad: </h2>
                Force restarting your iPad requires holding one of your two volume buttons 
                and the power button down and dragging the slider towards the right edge 
                then, once the device has powered off, holding the power button until it 
                turns back on. If your iPad has a home button, holding the volume button is 
                not required.<br><br>

                <h2>Android: </h2>
                To restart your Android device, hold the power button for 20s until 
                the screen goes black. Certain devices require your to hold both the 
                power/side button and the volume down button.<br><br>
            </div>
            <div class="clickable-header">
                <h1 onclick="toggleParagraph('reinstall-software')"><b>[2]</b> Reinstall the software</h1>
            </div>
            <div id="reinstall-software" class="hidden-text">
                Another step, should a restart fail to fix your problem, is reinstalling 
                whichever software you're having issues with. Of course, if your 
                operating system is the problem, this won't help but
